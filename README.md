# 6D-Pose-Estimation

In this project, we reused the code provided by the authors of [Deep Object Pose Estimation for Semantic Robotic Grasping of Household Objects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1809.10790.pdf).

# The original code can be found in the following [Github](https://github.com/NVlabs/Deep_Object_Pose).
